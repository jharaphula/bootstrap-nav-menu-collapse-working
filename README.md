# Issue resolved BootStrap nav menu Collapse expand working

I noticed many developers are facing issues while integrating bootstrap menu. Generally issue found during collapse and expand. For an example if you are integrating bootstrap nav menu in Codeignitor php framework that time CDN links for bootstrap.min.css and bootstrap.bundle.min.js not working. In this scenario you need to download and integrate bootstrap inside the app folder.

# Technical details for BootStrap nav menu integration

In this demo app I created and index.html file followed by style.css. In head section I am calling css/bootstrap.min.css file. which resides inside my css folder.

To make the Collapse and expand working before end of body tag I am calling js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js from my js folder.

You can download and try.
